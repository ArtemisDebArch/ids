Idea for a class


class Alumni(Student):

    def __init__(self, number_of_students):
        super().__init__()
        self.number_of_students = number_of_students

        self.students = []

        for x in range(number_of_students):
            self.students.append(Student())

    def show(self):
        print(self.students)

    def print_all(self, filename: str):
        for val in self.students:
            self.students[val].print_to_file(filename)
